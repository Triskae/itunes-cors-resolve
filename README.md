# itunes-cors-resolve

### How does it work ?

First, clone the project locally.

Run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies.

Run ``npm start`` to start the node web server.

It will run on http://localhost:4000 

To search a music, simply access the route http://localhost:4000/search/:term


Example of route, access this link through your browser once the node server had started: http://localhost:4000/search/acdc


And you are done with annoying cors :)
